Howdy cowboy!
this is a garbage dump on fire. it is supposed to be a bank statement web app. using mongodb and nodejs backend server.
it miserably failed. blockers when connecting the mongo database to the node js server. idk why.

to run whatever we have, run node server.js (frontend). and run npm run dev (backend) in a separate terminal. maybe something
works. woop woop! 

i think the problem relies in the mongodb installation and the fact that school computers don't have admin privileges.
