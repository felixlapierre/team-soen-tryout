Howdy cowboy!
To run our code, checkout the Jun branch and run the following commands in the project folder:

npm install

node server.js

This will start the server on port 5000.

You can connect by entering localhost:5000 in the address bar of a web browser.
Only one user exists on the server. The username is Felix and the password is password. We couldn't get the database to work so that's all we got!
